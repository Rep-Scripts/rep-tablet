> ## **INTRODUCTION**

So, we make groups jobs. From the early versions of ps-playergroups since August 2022, to the latest qb-phone Nopixel inspired.

However, these versions came with features that we didnt like, and 4 months later, we have released our own versions.

The tablet is made so our customers who dont use qb-phone to enjoy our group jobs.

**There are no jobs or anything included with these files.**
**Check out the jobs at our Tebex.**
